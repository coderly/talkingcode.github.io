excerpt: Current teaching, and learning, methods are inherently flawed. We all need to be shipping faster, and skipping the beginner material.

# Stop Learning through Hoops

Earlier today, I was chatting with some friends about learning by doing.

My buddy, [Andrew Culver](https://twitter.com/andrewculver), is thinking about recording and sharing an 8-hour session of him coding up the easy parts of his new SaaS app.

It really got me thinking about the best ways to learn about making things online.

## The Typical Hoops

When I learned how to code, I sought out learning materials in the order we're all taught to learn.

> Beginner &middot; Intermediate &middot; Advanced

The problem with this flow, is that no stage of it involves shipping real work.

Sure, there are plenty of tutorials floating around that zoom out and have you build a sample app. But often, you're left with a functional, shitty app that doesn't excite you, and that only taught surface-level lessons which will soon be forgotten.

The only real way to learn is by doing. Does that require introductory material to prepare? Absolutely.

> But if you ask me, the way we currently teach is just plain wrong.

## The Proper Way to Teach

The only tutorial I've seen that teaches the way I'd like to be taught, is [Execute iOS](http://executeios.com).

I've always felt a connection to the Execute mentality. There is nothing like the momentum that comes from starting and shipping a product, article, or anything else in a condensed amount of time. It's thrilling!

So when [Josh Long](https://twitter.com/joshlong) and [Sam Soffes](https://twitter.com/soffes) released Execute iOS with the goal of teaching people how to make an iPhone app, from first line of code through to App Store submission, I had some doubts...but I also knew that if anyone could pull it off, it'd be these guys.

So I bought the course.

I'd always wanted to know a little Objective-C. Not alot. Just a little.

Just enough to ship a bare-bones app to run alongside any of my future products. The more I can ship myself, the less I need to work with others &ndash; which extends my runway and drastically improves the overall quality/**synergy** â˜º of my products.

I figured within a few months, it would make sense to add an iOS component to [HookFeed](http://hookfeed.com?utm_source=rocketship-blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=learning-through-hoops), so I splurged and bought the course for the future.

I didn't plan on watching the videos for a while, but I watched one and I was hooked.

I got sucked into the excitement of building an app in a foreign language, knowing that mere hours from that moment, I'd be looking at a functional, beautiful app which I actually had a need for.

And it's not just the need for the useful end result that made this course different.

Most importantly, it's the fact that you can tell Josh and Sam didn't sit down and say what can we build in a weekend that beginners will understand. They took an awesome app that they wanted and **figured out a way** to teach it.

This wasn't beginner material, folks. They covered everything from, "what's a loop?" to, "how do I connect my iOS app to an API?"

It's critical when teaching, and learning, to break out of the traditional methods that have been taught to us.

> You no longer need credentials. You no longer need to read the Dummies book first. You just need to want to learn or teach something badly enough that you'll construct the best curriculum out there.

I'll never know how many hours were spent editing the content in the videos down into the perfect sequence and timing. Or how much time was spent on scripting out what to focus on. But I do know that of all the tutorials, videos, and books I've consumed over the past 7 years with the intent of getting better at my craft...this was the best.

> And I hope more come out just like it...
