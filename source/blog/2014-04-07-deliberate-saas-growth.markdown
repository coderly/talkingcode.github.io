# Deliberate SaaS Growth

> "Just build a product that you need...and others will want it too."

**I used to believe that.** Then a few months ago, I started to have doubts, but tried my damnest to ignore them.

And now, I've finally acknowledged that it's not the proper way to start with your SaaS product.

## You Should Build for Yourself...
Just not only yourself. It's smart to build a product that you crave for a couple of reasons:

1. You'll be driven to ship your product so you can start using it.
2. You'll know the audience you'll be selling to, and how best to market to them.

But the problem that creeps in *(and that bit us in the ass repeatedly)* is that it's so easy to focus on the product you're building for yourself, that you don't stop to think about the big picture.

> You don't set ambitious SaaS growth goals.

And you're product roadmap gets driven by flavor-of-the-week advice and customer feedback, rather than being driven by deliberate decisions.
