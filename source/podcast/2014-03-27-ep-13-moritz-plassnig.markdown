summary: |
  We talked with <a href="https://twitter.com/moritzplassnig">Mo Plassnig</a>, co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.codeship.io/">Codeship</a>. He talked about how their passion for education, teaching through video and blog posts, is baked into who they are as a company. He also touched on how creating a “wow” factor for people in the first couple minutes of using their product has been huge in moving the needle for them.
