  In this episode we talked with <a href="https://twitter.com/markfidelman">Mark Fidelman</a>, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/markfidelman/">Forbes</a> columnist and founder of <a href="https://www.raynforest.com/">Raynforest</a>. He shared some incredible tips for how to get content published and your company promoted in big publications like Forbes. They’re techniques that anyone can use, and if you ever thought the only way to get written about was to take a big round of funding, he’ll prove you wrong. Great, actionable stuff in this interview.
